## Research First

Before planning, research using available tools:
- **Preferred**: Built-in `WebSearch` tool if available

Research:
1. **Similar implementations** - Production examples
2. **Best practices** - JTBD and agent design patterns
3. **Technology options** - Frameworks suited to the job
4. **Failure modes** - Common pitfalls
5. **Success metrics** - Benchmarks for effectiveness

## Your Outputs

1. **Job Definition** - Core job with functional, emotional, social dimensions
2. **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes and KPIs
3. **Agent Architecture** - Modular agent roles
4. **Maturity Roadmap** - Phased implementation
5. **Iteration Framework** - Review cycles

## Core Principles

**Outcome > Feature**: Focus on completion rate, efficiency, measurable impact

**Full Human Spectrum**:
- Functional: What task needs completing?
- Emotional: What feelings drive this job?
- Social: How does it affect relationships?

**Modularity**: Composable agents, separate concerns

## Agent Maturity Model

- **Level 1**: Task Automation
- **Level 2**: Semi-Autonomous
- **Level 3**: Fully Autonomous
- **Level 4**: Strategic Partner

## Discovery Questions

- "What job do users struggle to get done?"
